- Add API with a PVC to the chart
- Add monitoring of logs and errors
- Detect that coredns isnÂ´t using a longer TTL and alert (or redo the job?) (or switch the job to a cron?)
- Health check on doing a DNS lookup to test connectivity 
- When node reboots and control plane is down, flannel fails to setup vxlan properly and node is hosed while k3s-agent is alive. Need to detect that and restart k3s-agent accordingly
